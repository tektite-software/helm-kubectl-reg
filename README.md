# Overview

This image is based on [dtzar's helm-kubectl](https://github.com/dtzar/helm-kubectl) image, but adds a compiled executable of [genuinetools's `reg`](https://github.com/genuinetools/reg) for interacting with Docker registries.

This image can be used the same way as `dtzar/helm-kubectl`.
